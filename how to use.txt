1X:            pushes x onto the stack
2               coppys the top value and pushes it onto the stack
3               flips the stack
4               pushes user input to the stack
5               adds the two top values
6               pops and prints the top value of the stack
[                sets the start of a loop
]                goes to the begining of the loop if the top value of the stack is 0
